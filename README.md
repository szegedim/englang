# englang
Englang is a new programming language
## Rules
There are only two basic rules in Englang
1. Englang compiles to other programming languagages or machine code
2. When in doubt, the syntax of the English language defines the syntax
## Why
1. The English language has been evolved in thousands of years, all programming languages are just few decades old
2. The human language fits the human brain the best
3. Machines became smart and cheap enough to handle the human language
4. Basic programming tasks can be performed by folks with vocal education
5. It is easy to debug and maintain
6. It is easy to index and search
7. There is nothing more portable than telling your code to your neighbour
8. There is no need for comments
9. You can even use rich text
10. You can track the emotions of your developers and figure out with machine learning when they really need a raise
11. Finally I won't need three different passwords to set up the smart plug for my Christmas Tree
